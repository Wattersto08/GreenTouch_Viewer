Tools for viewing and handling GPS located data for use in agriculture 


### todo: 

- [ ] add a data dump to text file for the object class 
- [x] add a data point matrix to the objet class 
- [ ] add a savedown and recall function to SQL for each class 
- [ ] migrate visualisation using folium 
- [x] migrate point location function 
- [x] add configurable bearing to the point generation 
- [ ] add spinup / shutdown cycle 
- [ ] use perlin noise functionality to generate mock data 
- [ ] host folium plot in a web socket - plotly dash looks like a viable solution here 
- [ ] find / generate more google earth testdata for testing 
- [ ] bring in new test data via .csv 
- [ ] refactor RSQL.py (much later)
- [x] return coordinate midpoint for farm - for folium look @
- [ ] refactor data point matrix, will need to create a circle of points, then rotate, then crop (currenly missing corners)
